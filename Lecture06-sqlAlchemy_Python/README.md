Check out the sqlalchemy documentation and tutorials:
https://www.sqlalchemy.org/

And see, you can also do ORM in Java. Well do that next week:
https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/

But for that you will use the JDBC api, and not sqlalchemy.

The names of these libraries / apis dont matter, there are a million of them. You just need to know that - for whatever project you work on - there is a nice way to integrate a db into it.

Also we will work on a django project soon:
